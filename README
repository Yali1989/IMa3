Fixed a bug that got into the code in late may 2018 when the default
mode for updating with multiple heated chains was altered. 
This causes a distortion of the distribution of the phylogeny posterior
(i.e. when -j0 is used).  The bug was not present for the runs 
in the IMa3 paper  (Hey et al.,2018. MBE 35:2805â€“2818; doi:2810.1093/molbev/msy2162)
